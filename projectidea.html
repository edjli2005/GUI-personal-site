		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p title="Introduction">I've used many a news aggregator as well as new tab chrome extensions that want to show you your day's schedule and other useful information and maybe some interesting news along the way, but none of them have particularly been stellar at combining the two ideas. Some are either made to do one simple thing or are too disorganized to really be useful to me. </p>

		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p title="Description">I want to build a site that gives <b><u>me, the user</u></b>, a snapshot of what the internet is up to today in a clean and orderly fashion. A good word to describe the theme/motivation behind this site is discovery. I want to learn about or discover something new each and every day.</p>

		<h4>Goals</h4>
		<p title="Goals">I want to be able to see innteresting things going on in the world such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A news article about our country and about the world</li>
				<li>A trending twitter post/hashtag</li>
				<li>Some interesting instructables project I might be interested in</li>
				<li>A random new video from someone I follow on Youtube or a random post/pin/tweet/etc from some user I follow that might be interesting that leads to a new discovery</li>
				<li>A random new photo from flickr feeds I follow as the background</li>
				<li>Something from RSS feeds I follow</li>
				<li>A random interesting podcast from NPR or similar</li>
				<li>An interesting word of the day</li>
				<li>An inspirational quote of the day</li>
				<li>Some pretty simple technical stuff such as the weather, date and time</li>
			</ul>
		<p title="Conclusion">I'll be able to follow all these posts to their sources. The site will be sort of like <a href="http://fuckinghomepage.com/">Fucking Homepage</a>, but a little less profane and prettier. I want it to be user customizable to show more relevant content but still retain the element of surprise.</p>
